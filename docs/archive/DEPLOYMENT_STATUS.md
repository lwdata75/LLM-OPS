# 🚀 Deployment in Progress

## ⏳ Current Status

Your **nutrition-assistant-phi3** model is being deployed to Vertex AI!

### What's Happening:
1. ✅ Endpoint created: `nutrition-assistant-endpoint`
2. ⏳ Deploying model with GPU (T4) configuration
3. ⏳ Estimated time: **15-30 minutes**

### Endpoint Information:
- **Endpoint ID**: `5724492940806455296`
- **Region**: `europe-west2`
- **Machine**: n1-standard-8 + NVIDIA Tesla T4
- **Console**: [Monitor Deployment](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/endpoints/5724492940806455296?project=aerobic-polygon-460910-v9)

---

## 📊 Check Deployment Status

### Option 1: Run Monitor Script
```powershell
python scripts/monitor_deployment.py
```
This will:
- Check if deployment is complete
- Automatically update your `.env` file with the endpoint ID
- Tell you when it's ready to test

### Option 2: Check Console
Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/endpoints/5724492940806455296?project=aerobic-polygon-460910-v9

Look for:
- ✅ Green checkmark = Ready
- ⏳ Loading icon = Still deploying
- ❌ Red X = Error (check logs)

## ⏰ What to Do While Waiting

### 1. Install Chainlit (if not done)
```powershell
pip install chainlit requests
```

### 2. Review the Files Created
- `src/handler.py` - Custom endpoint handler
- `src/app/main.py` - Chainlit web app
- `scripts/test_endpoint.py` - Testing tool

### 3. Check Documentation
- `SESSION4_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Full guide
- `SESSION4_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Technical details
- `QUICK_START_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Quick reference

### 4. Take a Break! ☕
Deployment takes 15-30 minutes. Perfect time for:
- Coffee break
- Review what you learned
- Plan your test questions

---

## 🎯 Once Deployment Completes

### Automatic Setup:
When you run `python scripts/monitor_deployment.py` and deployment is complete:
- ✅ `.env` file will be updated automatically
- ✅ Endpoint ID will be added
- ✅ Ready to test immediately

### Quick Test:
```powershell
# Test the endpoint
python scripts/test_endpoint.py --prompt "What are the benefits of spinach?"
```

### Run Chainlit App:
```powershell
chainlit run src/app/main.py -w
```
Opens at: http://localhost:8000 🎉

## 📝 Expected Timeline

| Step | Duration | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Endpoint creation | 1-2 min | ✅ Complete |
| Model deployment | 15-30 min | ⏳ In Progress |
| First inference | 30-60 sec | ⏳ Pending |
| Ready to chat | - | ⏳ Pending |

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check logs in console (link above)
2. Verify GPU quota: IAM & Admin → Quotas
3. Try different machine type or region

### If it's taking too long (>30 min):
1. Check console for status
2. Look for error messages in logs
3. Deployment may be queued due to resource availability

## 💰 Cost Reminder

**The endpoint will cost ~$0.50-$1.00 per hour** while running.

**Don't forget to delete it after testing:**
1. Vertex AI → Endpoints
2. Select endpoint
3. Click "Undeploy model"
4. Click "Delete endpoint"

## 🎉 You're Almost There!

The hard work is done:
- ✅ Pipeline trained successfully (1.5 hours)
- ✅ Model registered to Vertex AI
- ✅ Handler and web app created
- ⏳ Deployment in progress (15-30 min)

Check back in **20 minutes** and run:
```powershell
python scripts/monitor_deployment.py
```
